# BadBankGoogleLogin

This is an update to the BadBank project. It is an activity for MITx Pro FullStack WebDev.

# Description: 
> Short project description. 

It still needs some refinement but the main functionality that I wanted to include (GoogleLogin) is implemented. This is an activity for wee 27 of MITx Pro FullStack WebDev program. The idea is the project is to provide a WebApp with basic Bank functionality such as add, withdraw money, login, logout, and view historical data.

# Installation: 
> There are a few things you need in order to run this project.

If you want to test this project you will have to download all the files from this repository and place them in a folder in your computer. Install the packages located in the file packages.json. You will require express, firebase, firebase-admin, and cors.

In order to install the packages use a terminal window and run npm install followed by the package, for example this instruction will install express for this project:

npm install express

# Usage: 
> This project has a very simple user interface.

After installing all the packages you will need to run it by using "node index.js" from the root folder of the project (withouth the double quotes). After running node index.js open a browser (it is recommended to open a new browser in incognito mode) and go to localhost:3000. Port 3000 is the default port for this project.

# Roadmap:

c) Add a database to add new users and maybe even operations per users.
d) Add basic reports capabilitis suchs historical data.
